# Light Curve Classification Using ML
This project was created for the purpose of the final project of Machine Learning in Geology 6932 for Spring 2025. This code uses a convolusional neural network to detect and classify signals in Transitting Exoplanet Survey Satelite (TESS) light curves as planetary signal, binary signal or no identifiable signal. 

Inputs:
  - TIC ID of object of interest
  - Period in days of object of interest

Outputs:
  - Likelihood of each type of signal present in the light curve
  - MCMC best-fit-parameters for the transit

Dependences:
