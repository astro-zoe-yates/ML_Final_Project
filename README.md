# Light Curve Classification Using ML
This project was created for the purpose of the final project of Machine Learning in Geology 6932 for Spring 2025. This code uses TESS light curve observations to train a convolusional neural network to detect and classify signals in light curves as planetary signal, binary signal or no identifiable signal.
